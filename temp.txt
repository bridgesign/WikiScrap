On 2 June 1983, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 operating the service developed an in-flight fire behind the washroom that spread between the outer skin and the inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The spreading fire also burned through crucial electrical cables that knocked out most of the instrumentation in the cockpit, forcing the plane to divert to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Ninety seconds after the plane landed and the doors were opened, the heat of the fire and fresh oxygen from the open exit doors created flashover conditions, and the plane's interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 passengers who had yet to evacuate the aircraft.

The flight took off at about 9:24\u00a0p.m. on 20 February 2005. When the plane, a four engine Boeing 747\u2013436, was around 300 feet into the air, flames burst out of its number 2 engine, a result of engine surge. The pilots shut the engine down. Air traffic control expected the plane to return to the airport and deleted the flight plan. However, after consulting with the airline dispatcher, the pilots decided to set off on their flight plan \"and get as far as we can\" rather than dump 70 tonnes of fuel and land. The 747 is certified to fly on three engines. Having reached the East Coast, the assessment was that the plane could continue safely. The cross-Atlantic journey encountered less favourable conditions than predicted. Upon reaching the UK, believing there to be insufficient usable fuel to reach their destination, the captain declared an emergency and landed at Manchester Airport.", "Date": "20 February 2005", "Summary": "Engine fire (No.2) and shutdown on climbout", "Site": "Los Angeles, US", "Passengers": "351", "Crew": "18", "Fatalities": "0", "Survivors": "369 (all)", "Aircraft\u00a0type": "Boeing 747\u2013436", "Operator": "British Airways", "Registration": "G-BNLG", "Destination": "London Heathrow, UK"}, 1, "2005"], [{"info": "Air Transat Flight 961 was an Air Transat flight from Varadero, Cuba to Quebec City, Canada on March 6, 2005.
