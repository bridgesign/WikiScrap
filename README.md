# Wikipedia Data Scraping
Just a small project of webscraping using python for <b>ES112 : Computing.</b> Probably very naive. Feel free to contribute.
<br><br>The first, incidents.py finds the aviation incidents in the year given year. The second (fatality.py), takes two inputs. First Input tells the number of top n most fatal incidents that occured. Second gives the incdents that occured in the last y years where y is input.
<br><br>The data required to be loaded in second file takes about an hour. So, a copy of the data is given in temp.txt. Delete it to redownload the data. The data download is kept slow so as not to load the wikipedia servers.
<br>
# Requirements:
Python 3 with requests and BeautifulSoup4 library installed.<br>
<br>Wikipedia data:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft
<br>and other links on that page.
